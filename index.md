# WhachaCallit Med
Making medical information more accessible and understandable to patients.
https://whatchacallit.github.io/docs/

## Overview


<blockquote>
“I truly believe that patients have the power to
influence the future of health care -
The moment that patients really understand
their important and vital role in this healthcare
transformation, they become the leading
force.”
<i>Larisa A., Patient Champion Health Hack 2020</i>
</blockquote>

## The Challenge
Patients often struggle with specialized terminology and the sheer
amount of information available on their health conditions – e.g.
medical reports, research papers, studies, treatment brochures ...

Key challenges patients commonly encounter:

* Text is **complicated and too long**
* **Special terminology** is not understandable
* The text is **not easily accessible** (readability, unknown language,
small fonts, too narrow etc.)
* Source and **credibility** of information is unknown


## Our Vision
A solution to help patients navigate through the often complex and confusing world of medical information. Help patients to be empowered to manage their disease and make informed decisions with their care teams.

On top, caregivers, family and friends supporting their loved ones on their journey have a tool at hand that they can use or recommend as a trusted source
